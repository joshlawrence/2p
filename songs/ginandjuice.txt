I'm serious nigga one of y'all niggas got some bad motherfucking breath
Oh man aye baby, aye baby, shit,
Aye baby get some bubblegum in this motherfucker or something
Aye, nigga, get something to eat, dog
Study long, study wrong nigga

With so much drama in the L-B-C
It's kinda hard being Snoop D-O-double-G
But I, somehow, some way
Keep coming up with funky ass shit like every single day
May I, kick a little something for the G's
And, make a few ends as I breeze, through
Two in the morning and the party's still jumping
'Cause my momma ain't home
I got bitches in the living room getting it on
And, they ain't leaving 'til six in the morning, six in the morning
So what you wanna do, shit
I got a pocket full of rubbers and my homeboys do too
So turn off the lights and close the doors
But—but what?—we don't love them hoes
So we gon' smoke a ounce to this
G's up, hoes down, while you motherfuckers bounce to this

[2x]
Rolling down the street, smoking indo, sipping on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Now, that I got me some Seagram's gin
Everybody got they cups, but they ain't chipped in
Now this type of shit, happens all the time
You got to get yours but fool I gotta get mine
Everything is fine when you listening to the D-O-G
I got the cultivating music that be captivating he
Who listens to the words that I speak
As I take me a drink to the middle of the street
And get to macking to this bitch named Sadie
Sadie?
She used to be the homeboy's lady
Oh, that bitch
Eighty degrees, when I tell that bitch please
Raise up off these N-U-Ts, 'cause you gets none of these
At ease, as I mob with the Dogg Pound, feel the breeze
Bitch, I'm just

[2x]
Rolling down the street, smoking indo, sipping on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Later on that day
My homie Dr. Dre came through with a gang of Tanqueray
And a fat ass J, of some bubonic chronic that made me choke
Shit, this ain't no joke
I had to back up off of it and sit my cup down
Tanqueray and chronic, yeah I'm fucked up now
But it ain't no stopping, I'm still popping
Dre got some bitches from the city of Compton
To serve me, not with a cherry on top
'Cause when I bust my nut, I'm raising up off the cot
Don't get upset girl, that's just how it goes
I don't love you hoes, I'm out the door
And I'll be

[2x]
Rolling down the street, smoking indo, sipping on gin and juice
Laid back with my mind on my money and my money on my mind

Rolling down the street, smoking indo, sipping on gin and juice, bitch
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
Rolling down the street, smoking indo, sipping on gin and juice, bitch
With my mind on my money and my money on my mind
