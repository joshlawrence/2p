# POUR SOME SUGAR ON ME

Step inside / Walk this way
You and me babe / Hey hey

Cm
Love is like a bomb, baby, c'mon get it on
Livin' like a lover with a radar phone
Lookin' like a tramp, like a video vamp
Demolition woman, can I be your man? (your man)

Razzle 'n' a dazzle 'n' a flash a little light
Television lover, baby, go all night
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss innocent sugar me, yeah, yeah

F
Now c'mon, take a bottle, shake it up
Eb
Break the bubble, break it up

Pour some sugar on me
Ooh, in the name of love
Pour some sugar on me
C'mon, fire me up
Pour your sugar on me
I can't get enough

Cm
I'm hot, sticky sweet / From my head to my feet, yeah

Listen, red light, yellow light, green-a-light go
Crazy little woman in a one man show
Mirror queen, mannequine, rhythm of love
Sweet dream, saccharine, loosen up (loosen up)

You gotta squeeze a little, squeeze a little
Tease a little more
Easy operator come a knockin' on my door
Sometime, anytime, sugar me sweet
Little miss innocent sugar me, yeah, yeah
Give a little more

You got the peaches, I got the cream
Sweet to taste, saccharine
'Cause I'm hot (hot), say what, sticky sweet
From my head (head), my head, to my feet
Do you take sugar? One lump or two?

CHORUS / OUT
