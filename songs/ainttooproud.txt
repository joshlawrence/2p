# AIN'T TOO PROUD TO BEG

I know you wanna leave me
But I refuse to let you go
If I have to beg and plead for your sympathy
I don't mind, 'cause you mean that much to me

Ain't too proud to beg and you know it (sweet darlin')
Please don't leave me girl (don't you go)
Ain't too proud to plead, baby, baby
Please don't leave me, girl (don't you go)

Now I heard a cryin' man
Is half a man, with no sense of pride
But if I have to cry to keep you
I don't mind weepin' if it'll keep you by my side

CHORUS

If I have to sleep on your doorstep
All night and day
Just to keep you from walkin' away
Let your friends laugh, even this I can stand
'Cause I wanna keep you, any way I can

CHORUS

Now I've gotta love so deep, in the pit of my heart
And each day it grows more and more
I'm not ashamed to come, and plead to you baby
If pleadin' keeps you from, walkin' out that door

CHORUS / OUT
