# HARD TO HANDLE

Baby here I am
I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you gotta' come home with me

I've got some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You gotta' come back for more

    Boys and things that come by the dozen
    That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
    Hey little thing let, me light your candle
    'Cause mama I'm sure hard to handle now, gets around

Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of great experience
I know you got another man
But I can love you better than him

Take my hand, don't be afraid
I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free
So you can place your ad with me
