# FIREMAN

Well they call me the fireman that's my name\
Making my rounds all over town putting out old flames\
Well everybody'd like to have a what I got\
I can cool 'em down when they're smold'ring hot\
I'm the fireman that's my name\

Last night they had a bad one a mile or two down the road\
Well my buddy walked out and left his woman burning out of control\
Well I was down there in about an hour or so\
With a little mouth to mouth she was ready to go\
I'm the fireman that's my name\

CHORUS

Got a fire engine red and a Tbird automobile\
In a minute or less I can be dressed fit to kill\
I work 24 on 24 off\
When they get too hot they just give me a call\
I'm the fireman that's my name\

CHORUS

They call me the fireman that's my name
