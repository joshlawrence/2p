# NO DIGGITY

Shorty get down, good Lord\
Baby got 'em open all over town\
Strictly biz, you don't play around\
Cover much ground, got game by the pound

Getting paid is a forte\
Each and every day, true player way\
I can't get her out of my mind (Well)\
I think about the girl all the time (well, well)

East side to the west side\
Pushing phat rides, it's no surprise\
She got tricks in the stash\
Stacking up the cash\
Fast when it comes to the gas

By no means average\
She's on when she's got to have it\
Baby, you're a perfect ten, I wanna get in\
Can I get down, so I can win

I like the way you work it\
No diggity, I got to bag it up, bag it up

Hey yo, hey yo, hey yo, hey yo (4x)

CHORUS
