# DEAR PENIS

Dear penis\
I don't think I like you anymore\
You used to watch me shave\
Now all ya do is stare at the floor\
Oh dear penis\
I don't like you anymore

It used to be you and me\
A paper towel and a dirty magazine\
That's all we needed to get by\
Now it seems things have changed\
And I think that you're the one to blame\
Dear penis I don't like you anymore

He sings

Dear Rodney\
I don't think I like you anymore\
Cos when you get to drinking\
You put me places I've never been before\
Dear Rodney I don't like you anymore

Why cant we just get a grip\
On our man to hand relationship\
Come to terms with truly how we feel\
If we put our heads together\
We'd just stay home forever\
Dear penis I think I like you after all

Oh and Rodney\
While you're shaving shave my balls
