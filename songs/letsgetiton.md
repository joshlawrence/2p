# LET'S GET IT ON

I've been really tryin', baby\
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long\
And if you feel like I feel, baby\
Then, c'mon, oh, c'mon\

Let's get it on\
Ah, baby, let's get it on\

We're all sensitive people\
With so much to give\
Understand me, sugar\
Since we've got to be here Let's live\
I love you\

There's nothing wrong with me\
Loving you, baby no no\
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong\
If the love is true\

Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be\
I'm asking you baby to get it on with me\
I ain't gonna worry\
I ain't gonna push, won't push you baby\
So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby\
Stop beatin' 'round the bush\

CHORUS

There's nothing wrong with me\
Loving you, baby no no\
And giving yourself to me can never be wrong\
If the love is true\
