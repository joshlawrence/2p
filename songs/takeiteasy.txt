TAKE IT EASY

Well, I'm running down the road
tryin' to loosen my load
I've got seven women on my mind,

Four that wanna own me,
Two that wanna stone me,
One says she's a friend of mine

Take It easy, take it easy
Don't let the sound of your own wheels
drive you crazy

Lighten up while you still can
don't even try to understand
Just find a place to make your stand
and take it easy

Well, I'm a standing on a corner in Winslow, Arizona
and such a fine sight to see
It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford
Slowin' down to take a look at me

Come on, baby, don't say maybe
I gotta know if your sweet love is gonna save me
We may lose and we may win though
we will never be here again
so open up, I'm climbin' in,
so take it easy

Well I'm running down the road trying to loosen my load
Got a world of trouble on my mind
Lookin' for a lover who won't blow my cover
She's so hard to find

CHORUS
