# CAN'T YOU SEE

Gonna take a freight train\
Down at the station, Lord\
I don't care where it goes\
Gonna climb a mountain\
The highest mountain\
Jump off, nobody gonna know\

Can't you see, whoa, can't you see\
What that woman, Lord, she been doin' to me\
Can't you see, can't you see\
What that woman, she been doin' to me\

I'm gonna find me\
A hole in the wall\
I'm gonna crawl inside and die\
'Cause my lady, now\
A mean ol' woman, Lord\
Never told me goodbye\

CHORUS

I'm gonna buy a ticket, now\
As far as I can\
Ain't a-never comin' back\
Ride me a southbound\
All the way to Georgia, now\
Till the train, it run out of track\

CHORUS
