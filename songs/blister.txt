BLISTER IN THE SUN [G]

When I'm out walking
I strut my stuff
And I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite
I just might stop to check you out

Let me go on
Like a blister in the sun
Let me go on
Big hands, I know you're the one

Body and beats,
I stain my sheets
I don't even know why
My girlfriend, she's at the end,
She is starting to cry

CHORUS

When I'm out walking
I strut my stuff
And I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite
I just might stop to check you out

CHORUS
