# I'M A BELIEVER

I thought love was only true in fairy tales\
Meant for someone else but not for me\
Love was out to get me\
That's the way it seemed\
Disappointment haunted all of my dreams\

Then I saw her face, now I'm a believer\
Not a trace, of doubt in my mind\
I'm in love, and I'm a believer\
I couldn't leave her if I tried\

I thought love was more or less a giving thing\
The more I gave the less I got oh yeah\
What's the use in tryin'\
All you get is pain\
When I wanted sunshine I got rain\
