BABY GOT BACK

Oh, my, god, becky, look at her butt
It is so big, she looks like
One of those rap guys' girlfriends

I like big butts and I can not lie
You other brothers can't deny
That when a girl walks in with an itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face

You get sprung, want to pull up tough
'Cause you notice that butt was stuffed
Deep in the jeans she's wearing
I'm hooked and I can't stop staring

So, fellas (yeah) fellas (yeah)
Has your girlfriend got the butt? (Hell yeah)
Tell 'em to shake it (shake it) shake it (shake it)
Shake that healthy butt
Baby got back (la fits with the oakland booty)
Baby got back (la fits with the oakland booty)
