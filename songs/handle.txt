Baby, here I am
I'm the man on the scene
I can give you what you want
But you gotta come home with me
I have got some good old lovin'
And I got some more in store
When I get through throwin' it on you
You gotta come back for more

CHORUS:
Boys and things that come by the dozen
That ain't nothin' but drugstore lovin'
Pretty little thing let me light your candle
'Cause mama I'm so hard to handle now

Action speaks louder than words
And I'm a man of great experience
I know you've got another man
But I can love you better than him

Take my hand don't be afraid
I'm gonna prove every word I say
I'm advertising love for free
So you can place your ad with me

CHORUS

VERSE 1
