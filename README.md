# 2p

This repo contains my set list material for 2pianos.

- allsongs.txt - all songs listed in the [songs](songs/) directory
- `gen_songbook.sh` - prints all pdf files in [out](out/) to the default printer
- `refresh_songlist.sh` - bash script to refresh allsongs.txt
- setlist.md - a _very_ loose set list for my part of the show
- [songs](songs/) - all of my songs in text format

## A note about markdown...

Markdown requires using the `<br />` tag for line breaks, so it's easier to have the songs in txt format.
